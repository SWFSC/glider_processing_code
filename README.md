# glider_processing_code
The US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) program uses Slocum gliders for fisheries research. There are many steps in processing the data to integrate the multiple sensors with code. This repo is a compilation of code that is used to work with glider acoustic data and ultimately integrate it with the glider sensors. Some of the code is for extracting glider data from NC files created from SOCIB glider_toolbox (https://github.com/socib/glider_toolbox) for use with Echoview software. 
Some of the code uses code from spt (https://github.com/kerfoot/spt).
